Watching sporting events with fellow colleagues is a very popular pastime that many students enjoy every year. Tailgates with food and drinks before a football game makes the experience one of a kind. One of the great activities offered on college campuses is intramural sports. It allows college students to play the sport of their choosing at a fairly competitive level. All of these activities are an excellent ways to get involved and meet new people!</p>

Regardless of which major you choose, a college degree will ultimately benefit your career significantly! According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the weekly earnings in 2012 for someone with a Bachelor's Degree was $1,066. The median weekly salary of an individual with only a high school diploma was $652, which is significantly lower in the long run.

Completing your homework on time is crucial, however the most important part is understanding the material assigned in the homework. Another huge assignment in college are essays. Always develop a rough draft beforehand and revise several times before turning it in. This is just a rough foundation guide for succeeding in college, the rest of the process relies on a student applying themselves and keeping an organized schedule to complete all the tasks they need to accomplish.</p>
